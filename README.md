## Backend Dependencies

1. bcrypt: This package is used for hashing passwords securely. It allows you to hash and compare passwords,  commonly used in user authentication systems to securely store passwords.
2. body-parser: Body-parser is middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in Express.js. It extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.
3. cors: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. The cors package is used in Node.js/Express.js applications to enable CORS.
4. dotenv: Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It allows you to separate sensitive configuration data from your codebase and keep it in a separate file.
5. express: Express is a popular web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.
6. gridfs-stream: GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB. GridFS Stream is a Node.js module that provides a readable and writable stream interface for working with GridFS in MongoDB.
7. helmet: Helmet is a middleware for Express.js that helps secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. These headers can help protect your app from common security vulnerabilities.
8. jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The jsonwebtoken package is used for creating and verifying JWTs, which are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.
9. mongoose: Mongoose is an object modeling tool for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data, along with built-in type casting, validation, query building, and more.
10. morgan: Morgan is a middleware for logging HTTP requests in Node.js/Express.js applications. It simplifies the process of logging incoming HTTP requests to your server, providing information such as request method, URL, status code, response time, and more.
11. multer: Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files in Node.js/Express.js applications. It facilitates the handling of file uploads, including storing files on the server and handling form data.
12. multer-gridfs-storage: Multer GridFS Storage is a storage engine for Multer that enables uploading files directly to MongoDB's GridFS storage system. It's commonly used in conjunction with GridFS for handling file uploads in MongoDB.
13. nodemon: Nodemon is a utility that monitors changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected. It's commonly used during development to streamline the development process and eliminate the need for manual server restarts after code changes.
