# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Libraries Used

1. formik: Formik is a popular form library for React. It helps simplify form management by handling form validation, submission, and error handling. Formik provides a React component-based approach to building and managing forms, making it easier to create complex forms with less boilerplate code.
2. react: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications. React is widely used for building interactive and dynamic web applications.
3. react-dom: React DOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used to render React components to the DOM (Document Object Model). It's typically used alongside React to render React components within a web browser.
4. react-dropzone: React Dropzone is a React component for handling file uploads in web applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to upload files by dragging and dropping them onto the designated drop zone area. React Dropzone simplifies the process of implementing file uploads in React applications.
5. react-redux: React Redux is the official React bindings for Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a way to integrate Redux with React applications, allowing components to access and update global application state managed by Redux. React Redux facilitates the development of scalable and maintainable React applications with complex state management requirements.
6. react-router-dom: React Router DOM is a package that provides routing capabilities for React applications. It allows developers to define and manage routes in React applications, enabling navigation between different views or pages based on URL changes. React Router DOM simplifies client-side routing in single-page applications built with React.
7. react-scripts: React Scripts is a set of scripts and configurations used by Create React App, a popular tool for bootstrapping React applications. It includes various build scripts, development tools, and configurations for managing React projects. React Scripts abstracts away complex build configurations, allowing developers to focus on writing React code.
8. redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store for managing application state, which can be accessed and updated using pure functions called reducers. Redux is commonly used in conjunction with React to manage complex application state and facilitate data flow between components.
9. redux-persist: Redux Persist is a library for persisting Redux state to local storage or other storage engines in web applications. It allows developers to persist and rehydrate application state across page reloads or browser sessions, ensuring that user data is preserved even after the application is closed or refreshed.
10. web-vitals: Web Vitals is a JavaScript library and set of metrics for measuring and monitoring the performance of web pages. It provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page load speed, interactivity, and visual stability, helping developers optimize the user experience of their web applications.
11. yup: Yup is a JavaScript schema validation library for defining and validating object schemas. It provides a simple and declarative API for creating schema validation rules and validating input data against those rules. Yup is commonly used for form validation in React applications, especially when combined with libraries like Formik.
